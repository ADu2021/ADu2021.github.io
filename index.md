## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. Currently, I am interning at the Institute of AI Industry Research (AIR) of Tsinghua University, where I am supervised by Professors Yang Liu and Peng Li. I also interned with Prof. Diyi Yang at Stanford University. My research focuses on multimodal large language models and the synergy between humans and AI agents. I am proud to have achieved a demonstrating rank of 1 out of 173 students in my department.

<!-- I am currently visiting Stanford University as a summer intern in Professor Diyi Yang's group, and collaborating with Yanzhe Zhang and William Held. -->
**I am excited to share that I will be joining Carnegie Mellon University this fall to pursue my PhD in Language and Information Technology!**
