## About Me

I’m a first-year PhD student at the **Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University**, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [**<u>Prof. Chenyan Xiong</u>**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/).

Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University as an outstanding graduate under the guidance of [**<u>Prof. Yang Liu</u>**](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/).

My research explores **multimodal large language models** and recently I'm interested in how we can build better **foundation models for robotics** upon them. I’m always happy to chat or collaborate, so feel free to reach out!


<!-- I am currently visiting Stanford University as a summer intern in Professor Diyi Yang's group, and collaborating with Yanzhe Zhang and William Held. -->
<!-- **I am excited to share that I will be joining Carnegie Mellon University this fall to pursue my PhD in Language and Information Technology!** -->
